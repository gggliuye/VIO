G Loop Closure
=======================

The motivation of this article is to develop a method to reuse a offline refined map, by another online SLAM application. As we was developping a AR application, who objective to offer a good user experience. The biggest problems we have faced are, firstly the accumulcated draft of SLAM, and secondly correspondence between the online map and the visual effects made before.  All the two problems can be solved by the reuse of a prebuilt well-refined map.
